# ‚ú® TriStrike
Tristrike is a real-time lotto-inspired gambling game built with Express, Vanilla JavaScript, and WebSockets. It follows a Single Page Application (SPA) structure, where components dynamically update without requiring a full page reload. Players place bets on a combination of three cards and try to match the winning result. The game features a countdown timer, real-time balance updates, and a virtual betting system. 

TriStrike is also designed for scalability, featuring a load-balanced architecture using **HAProxy**, with **Dockerized master-slave MySQL replication** to ensure high availability and data redundancy.
